# Secure Voting System for Shareholder Meetings

This project implements a blockchain-based secure voting platform designed specifically for corporate shareholder meetings. The system ensures transparent, verifiable voting while maintaining appropriate privacy and preventing common issues like double-voting or vote manipulation.

## Core Components

1. **Shareholder Verification Contract**
    - Validates voting eligibility based on share ownership records
    - Implements share-weighted voting rights according to corporate bylaws
    - Provides secure authentication mechanisms for shareholders
    - Supports delegation of voting rights (proxy voting)

2. **Proposal Submission Contract**
    - Manages the creation and distribution of resolutions for consideration
    - Enforces proposal submission deadlines and formatting requirements
    - Facilitates amendment processes according to governance rules
    - Creates immutable record of all proposals and supporting documentation

3. **Vote Recording Contract**
    - Securely stores cast ballots while maintaining appropriate privacy
    - Prevents double-voting through cryptographic validation
    - Implements time-locked voting periods with automated closure
    - Allows shareholders to verify their own votes were recorded correctly

4. **Result Certification Contract**
    - Tallies votes according to corporate bylaws and share weights
    - Provides cryptographic proof of voting outcomes
    - Creates immutable, auditable record of meeting results
    - Generates official documentation of approved resolutions
